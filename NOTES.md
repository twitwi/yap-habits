TODO

- "no history" option (or limit to 1 or 2), browsing dates is a nightmare to go back on mobile especially
- maybe have a unit, mainly for display
- make "done" stuff autoadapt so that no jump, first a few big ones, then smallen automatically to fit
- consider allowing grouping them when smallened (e.g. []^3)
- edit colors (directly clicking on the color)
- maybe more structure list of possible stuff, e.g. foldeable categories etc, more a tree in the end, maybe even with category-parameter (typically a count, where the buttons can use the count (including multiply it by 2 etc))

- degit: integrate some menu-bar or see shopper-chopper
