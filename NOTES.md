TODO

- [ ] finish working on list edition etc and consolidate if it works
- make "done" stuff autoadapt so that no jump, first a few big ones, then smallen automatically to fit
- consider allowing grouping them when smallened (e.g. []^3)
- edit colors (directly clicking on the color)
- maybe more structure list of possible stuff, e.g. foldeable categories etc, more a tree in the end, maybe even with category-parameter (typically a count, where the buttons can use the count (including multiply it by 2 etc))

- degit: integrate some menu-bar or see shopper-chopper
